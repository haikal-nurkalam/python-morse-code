## Morse Code Converter
This is a simple Python script that converts user input into Morse code using the provided Morse code dictionary.

## Morse Code Dictionary
The Morse code dictionary is defined as a Python dictionary (MORSE_CODE_DICT) mapping each alphanumeric character and some special characters to their corresponding Morse code representation.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository or download the source code file morse_code_converter.py to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
3. Run the script using the following command:
python morse_code_converter.py
4. Enter the input text for conversion into Morse code when prompted.
5. The script will output the corresponding Morse code representation of the input.

## Input Requirements
The script only supports alphanumeric characters (A-Z, 0-9), space, comma, period, question mark, forward slash, hyphen, opening parenthesis, and closing parenthesis. Any other character will be considered invalid.
## Example
Input your morse code: Hello World
Output: .... . .-.. .-.. --- / .-- --- .-. .-.. -..

## Note
- The script automatically capitalizes each character of the input for consistent processing.
- If an invalid character is encountered in the input, the script will display a warning message and skip the conversion for that character.
- Feel free to modify and use this script according to your requirements.
